### Running the App

To run the app, simply run the `streamlit run Streamlit-Samples/Streamlit-ChatBot-App.py`.  This will start the app on port 8501.  You can then access the app at `http://localhost:8501`. If running in a container, you will need to forward the port to your local machine if VSCode does not do it for you automatically.

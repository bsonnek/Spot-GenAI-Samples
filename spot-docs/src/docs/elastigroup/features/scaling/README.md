# Scaling

Elastigroupâ€™s predictive autoscaling simplifies the process of defining scaling policies, identifying peak times and automatically scaling to ensure the right capacity in advance. Machine learning algorithms predict the future load of your application and proactively scale the cluster in order to accommodate peak traffic.
